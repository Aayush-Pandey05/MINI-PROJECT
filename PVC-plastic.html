            <p class="lead Para-1">Recycling PVC (polyvinyl chloride) plastic poses significant challenges due to its
                chlorine content and the presence of various additives that can release harmful chemicals during
                processing. Mechanical recycling, where PVC is shredded and reprocessed, is common but can degrade the
                material's quality. Chemical recycling, which breaks down PVC into its chemical components, offers a
                more sustainable solution but is still in the developmental stage and can be costly. Advances in
                technology and stricter regulations are driving improvements in PVC recycling, aiming to reduce
                environmental impact and promote circular economy practices. Proper sorting and contamination control
                are crucial to ensuring efficient recycling processes for PVC plastics.</p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading fw-normal lh-1 heading-2"><b>MECHANICAL RECYCLING</b></h2>
            <p class="lead Para-2">Mechanical recycling of PVC (polyvinyl chloride) involves collecting, sorting,
                cleaning, and then reprocessing the plastic into new products through physical means such as shredding
                and melting. This process typically begins with the removal of contaminants and non-PVC materials to
                ensure the purity of the recycled PVC. The cleaned PVC is then ground into small flakes or pellets,
                which can be melted and remolded into new products. However, mechanical recycling can degrade the
                quality of PVC due to thermal and mechanical stress, potentially limiting its applications. Additives in
                the original PVC, such as plasticizers and stabilizers, can complicate the recycling process and impact
                the properties of the recycled material. Despite these challenges, mechanical recycling remains a widely
                used method for managing PVC waste, contributing to resource conservation and reducing landfill use.</p>

            <p class="lead para-3">Chemical recycling of PVC (polyvinyl chloride) plastic involves breaking down the
                polymer into its basic chemical constituents through processes such as pyrolysis, hydrolysis, or
                solvolysis. This method allows for the recovery of valuable raw materials, such as hydrochloric acid and
                ethylene, which can be reused to produce new PVC or other products. Unlike mechanical recycling,
                chemical recycling can handle mixed or contaminated PVC waste and eliminate harmful additives. However,
                the process is complex and requires significant energy input, making it currently more expensive and
                less widely adopted than mechanical recycling. Ongoing research and technological advancements aim to
                improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of chemical recycling, offering a more sustainable
                solution for managing PVC waste in the long term.
