            <p class="lead Para-1">PET recycling is a crucial solution to reduce plastic waste and mitigate the crisis.
                The
                important recycling techniques of PET are mechanical recycling, chemical recycling and biorecycling. PET
                recycling is essential for sustainability and resource preservation. Mechanical recycling involves
                shredding PET waste into smaller pieces, followed by cleaning, melting, and molding. Chemical recycling
                processes like glycolysis and methanolysis produce high-quality PET monomers. Biological recycling uses
                enzymes or microorganisms to degrade PET waste into simpler compounds. This section of article will
                provide an overview of the various recycling techniques for PET and their benefits and limitations.</p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading fw-normal lh-1 heading-2"><b>MECHANICAL RECYCLING</b></h2>
            <p class="lead Para-2">Mechanical recycling is the most common method for recycling PET products, which
                involves
                collecting and shredding used PET products into small pieces, then washing and separating them from
                contaminants and melting them to create molten PET resin [. The clean PET flakes are then melted and
                molded into new products, such as bottles, fibers, or films. Mechanical recycling is a cost-effective
                and energy-efficient method that can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and conserve natural resources . It
                can also reduce the amount of PET products that end up in landfills or oceans, and contribute to the
                development of a circular economy. However, it has several limitations, such as the quality and quantity
                of collected PET products, contamination, and material quality. Alternative recycling methods, such as
                chemical or biorecycling, may be more appropriate.</p>

            <p class="lead para-3">Chemical recycling is an emerging technology that uses chemical reactions to break
                down PET
                products into their monomers, which can be used to produce new PET products [60]. Chemical recycling can
                overcome the limitations of mechanical recycling by converting PET waste into high-quality raw
                materials, such as purified terephthalic acid (PTA) and monoethylene glycol (MEG). Chemical recycling
                can also reduce greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption by up to 50% compared to virgin PET
                production [61]. However, chemical recycling requires specialized equipment and expertise, and the
                process can be costly and complex. Chemical recycling of PET involves breaking down the long chains of
                PET molecules into their individual monomers, which can then be used to make new PET or other products..
