            <p class="lead Para-1">Recycling of PP (polypropylene) plastic involves collecting, sorting, cleaning, and
                reprocessing the material to produce new products. PP is widely used in packaging, automotive parts,
                textiles, and consumer goods. Mechanical recycling is the predominant method, where PP is shredded into
                flakes, washed, melted, and reformed into pellets for manufacturing new items. This process, however,
                can degrade the polymer's properties over multiple cycles. Chemical recycling, though less common, can
                break down PP into its monomers for repolymerization, offering the potential for higher-quality recycled
                material. The main challenges in PP recycling include contamination, mixed plastic waste, and the cost
                of processing. Advances in recycling technologies and increased emphasis on waste sorting and clean
                recycling streams are essential to improve the efficiency and quality of recycled PP, supporting a more
                sustainable circular economy for plastics.</p>

            <p class="lead Para-2">Mechanical recycling of PP (polypropylene) plastic involves a series of steps to
                convert waste PP into reusable material. The process starts with the collection and sorting of PP waste,
                which is then cleaned to remove contaminants. The clean PP is shredded into small flakes, which are
                melted and extruded into pellets. These pellets can be used to manufacture new products such as
                automotive parts, containers, and textiles. However, the mechanical recycling process can degrade the
                polymer's properties, limiting the number of times PP can be recycled. Despite these challenges,
                mechanical recycling remains the most common and cost-effective method for recycling PP, contributing to
                waste reduction and resource conservation. Improving sorting technologies and processing methods can
                enhance the quality and efficiency of mechanically recycled PP, promoting its use in a broader range of
                applications.</p>

            <p class="lead para-3">Chemical recycling of PP (polypropylene) plastic involves breaking down the polymer
                into its monomers or other valuable chemicals through processes such as pyrolysis, gasification, or
                catalytic cracking. This method can handle contaminated or mixed plastic waste, converting it into
                high-purity raw materials that can be repolymerized into new PP with properties similar to virgin
                material. Chemical recycling offers the advantage of potentially infinite recyclability without
                significant degradation of material properties. However, it is less prevalent due to higher energy
                requirements, greater complexity, and higher costs compared to mechanical recycling. Advancements in
                chemical recycling technologies aim to make the process more economically viable and environmentally
                friendly, offering a sustainable solution for managing PP waste and reducing dependence on fossil fuels
                for new plastic production.
