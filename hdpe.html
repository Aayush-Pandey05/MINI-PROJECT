            <p class="lead Para-1">Recycling of High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE) plastic is an environmentally
                beneficial process that involves collecting, sorting, cleaning, and reprocessing used HDPE products into
                new materials. HDPE, commonly used in products like milk jugs, detergent bottles, and piping, is valued
                for its strength and resistance to moisture. The recycling process starts with the collection of HDPE
                items, which are then sorted by type and color. These items are cleaned to remove any contaminants,
                shredded into small flakes, and melted down. The molten plastic is extruded into pellets, which can be
                used to manufacture new products. This process conserves natural resources, reduces landfill waste, and
                lowers greenhouse gas emissions compared to producing new HDPE from virgin materials.</p>

            <p class="lead Para-2">Mechanical recycling of HDPE (High-Density Polyethylene) plastics begins with
                collecting and sorting HDPE waste, which is then shredded into small flakes. These flakes undergo
                thorough cleaning to remove contaminants before being melted and extruded into pellets or granules.
                These pellets serve as raw material for manufacturing various products such as bottles, containers, and
                pipes. This recycling process conserves energy compared to producing virgin HDPE and reduces plastic
                waste sent to landfills, though it faces challenges such as quality degradation with each cycle and the
                need for effective contamination control during cleaning. Despite these challenges, mechanical recycling
                plays a crucial role in sustainable waste management by reusing HDPE plastics and reducing environmental
                impact.</p>

            <p class="lead para-3">Chemical recycling of HDPE (High-Density Polyethylene) plastics involves breaking
                down the polymer into its constituent monomers or oligomers through processes like pyrolysis,
                glycolysis, or hydrolysis. These methods convert plastic waste into feedstocks that can be used to
                produce new plastics or other chemicals. Unlike mechanical recycling, which melts and reshapes plastics,
                chemical recycling aims to chemically transform the material, potentially yielding high-quality products
                similar to virgin materials. This approach is advantageous for handling mixed or contaminated plastics
                that are difficult to recycle mechanically.
